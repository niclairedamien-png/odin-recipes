    <h2>About Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Lasagne is a classic Italian dish that has delighted diners for centuries, 
        originating in the Emilia-Romagna region. </p>
    <p>It is a hearty and deeply satisfying baked pasta creation, 
    traditionally constructed from alternating layers of wide, 
    flat pasta sheets, rich tomato-based ragù (meat sauce), 
    and creamy Béchamel sauce. </p>
    <p>The dish is typically assembled in a rectangular pan and baked until the 
        top is golden brown and bubbling, 
        allowing the distinct flavours to meld into a comforting, 
        flavourful masterpiece. Though many regional and modern variations exist,
         the traditional preparation remains an enduring symbol of 
         Italian comfort food.</p>
