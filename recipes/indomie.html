    <h2>About Egusi</h2>
    <p>Egusi, also known as melon seed soup, is a popular West African dish especially cherished in Nigerian cuisine for its rich, nutty flavour and hearty texture. Made from ground melon seeds, the soup is typically cooked with palm oil, leafy vegetables such as spinach or bitter leaf, peppers, onions, and a variety of proteins like beef, goat meat, fish, or stockfish. The blended seeds thicken the soup, giving it a creamy, slightly grainy consistency that pairs perfectly with swallows such as pounded yam, fufu, or eba. Egusi is more than just a meal—it is a cultural staple often enjoyed at family gatherings and festive occasions.
